This version of the `TestDesign` package allows using multidimensional
items to perform adaptive test assembly. In addition to the optimal test
design framework for content balancing, this version also supports using
traditional heuristic methods, such as the weighted penalty method for
content balancing.

This work was done as a part of my dissertation, titled “Domain score
estimation in adaptive test assembly for single-subject multiple-domain
content”.
